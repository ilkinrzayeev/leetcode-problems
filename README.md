## 📖 Introduction

Welcome to a repository that captures the real-world impact of hands-on programming mentorship. Here, you’ll find the resources, solutions, and strategies I developed while guiding over 75 students—each with unique backgrounds—through the challenges of algorithmic and competitive programming on EOlymp. This collection is more than just code; it’s a record of growth, resilience, and the art of thinking like a true problem solver.
